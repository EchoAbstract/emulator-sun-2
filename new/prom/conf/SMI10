# November 5, 1985 by Philip Almquist
#
# => NOTE: until the various versions of sunmon.c are merged, the
#	   makefile generated by sunconfig for SMI processors must
#	   be edited to change all occurrences of "sunmon.c" to
#	   "ssunmon.c" and all occurrences of "sunmon.b" to
#	   "ssunmon.b" if the WATCHDOG option is used (it should be).
